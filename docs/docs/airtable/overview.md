We are using `Airtable` to store and manage the abuse reports sent by app users.

Our table for abuse reports is [here](https://airtable.com/appt58t6XthcfoN5i/tblYNGUfquRPtfXuq/viwOSFStjUrprDpNo?blocks=hide).

Airtable provides a flexible interface that can help users refine their data view. In the Abuse Reports table, we have a complete overview of a report submitted by a user, as well as extra fields for the admin to manage them.
