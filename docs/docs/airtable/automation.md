Airtable provides an [automation feature](https://www.airtable.com/product/automations). We can create `trigger - action` pairs to simulate repeated actions and be more efficient in managing the records.

## Sending an email to the reporter upon case completion ‚ö°Ô∏è

- We find `Automations` in the top right of our table page
- From the `Suggested Automations`, we choose `Create a custom automation`
- First we have to choose and create a `TRIGGER`:
  - in the `Trigger Type` we choose `When record matches conditions`
  - in the configuration, we select our working table and we fill in the conditions that have to be met for the trigger to happen.
- Then we move on to `ACTIONS`:
  - in the `Action Type` we choose `Send Email`
  - in the configuration we write a template, which we fill with the report specifics that come from our record. `Airtable` let us dynamically manage email addresses and pass fields from the table record into our fields. To do this we simply have to click on the `+` button and select `Record (from Step 1: ...)`

That's it! We have now successfully created an automation that allows us to send email to a reporter after their case has been marked as `Completed` in their record ‚ú®

In the following screenshots you can see that the user with `Completed` status has received an email with our template text and all the information we provide them as admin.
