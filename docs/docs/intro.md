# Introduction

## Welcome to Pairup Monorepo

The Pairup monorepo is split up into four sections:

- [API](api/overview)
- [CMS](cms/overview)
- [Native](native/overview)
- [Shared]

If you're not reading this in docusaurus, then I implore you to run `yarn docs` from the project root, because it's a lot nicer to read than this `markdown` format.

If I were you, i'd begin by looking at [getting started](/getting-started/initial-setup).
